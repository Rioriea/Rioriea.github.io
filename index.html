    <h3>Cyber Heist-React Puzzle Game</h3>
    <p>Cyber Heist is an interactive puzzle adventure game built with React and React Router, 
      featuring a full user flow including registration, login, and dynamic game progression.
       The project uses JSX and functional components with React hooks (useState) to manage 
       state and conditional rendering for NPC dialogues, map overlays, and level unlocking. 
       It incorporates a drag-and-drop puzzle system using the native HTML5 Drag and Drop API 
       combined with modular CSS for styling, including a custom monitor-themed UI for immersive
        gameplay. Levels and maps are data-driven through external configuration files enabling 
        scalable continent, country, and level structures with unique puzzles and hints.
         The app leverages controlled forms for authentication, flexible layout with CSS 
         Flexbox, and asset integration for backgrounds and icons. Overall, the project 
         demonstrates component-based architecture, responsive design, and user progression 
         logic in a complex single-page React application. </p>
